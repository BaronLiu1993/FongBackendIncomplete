Incomplete backend written in Express JS. I realised that I needed to switch backend technologies because originally I wanted the flexibility of express JS and JavaScript, but I realised for entreprise level applications I need a separate framework that has static typing and also because I struggled with managing + organizing all of my services. I was running into too many errors and I started writing spaghetti code to try to fix those errors. I was getting lost and writing very long functions, which made me realise I needed to find another strategy and framework that could accomodate for those needs. I am also more familiar with springboot. I also realised I need to switch to implementing microservice architecture instead of a monolithic architecture for greater scalability on the backend.
